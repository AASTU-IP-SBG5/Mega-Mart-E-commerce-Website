#Project description
MegaMart is a electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or
services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser.
MegaMart enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items.

Our main objective of the shopping system is to provide a convenient platform to provide products with
easy access and a fast delivery system. 

Like amazon it lets the seller post the product and update the site
daily for the available product that is present on the seller's hand; at the same time we get the commision
from the seller for selling the product and we get the delivery fee from the buyer.

What makes our service special is that we will have a robust,resourceful delivery system because we are
using a third party;already built up delivery system, like ride transportation or other companies who have
a lot of customers as a delivery mechanism and incorporate it with our ordering mechanism.

The other thing that is special about the project is that we will have a verification and a recommendation
system for sellers and buyers to guarantee that the products are safe and good.
And also we have a convenient payment system that is easily rechargeable and no need to enter shipping
address and payment card information all the time when buying products.
